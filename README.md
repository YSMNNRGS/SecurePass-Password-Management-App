# SecurePass-Password-Management-App
This is a user-friendly, intermediate-level Python-based password manager designed for personal use. The app allows users to securely store, view, update, and delete their login credentials, such as website names, emails, and passwords. All passwords are encrypted using the Fernet encryption system to ensure data safety and privacy.

The application is built with Tkinter for a smooth graphical user interface (GUI) and runs on a 1280x720 resolution for a clean and modern desktop experience. It also includes a custom background image, a password generator, and a secure SQLite database for storing the encrypted data locally.

To access sensitive data like saved passwords or to manage them, the user is required to enter a predefined admin passkey. This extra layer of security ensures that only authorized users can access or modify the stored information.

Key features include:

🔐 Save new passwords securely (with encryption)

👁 View all saved passwords after entering admin passkey

🔄 Update or 🗑 delete saved entries

🧠 Automatically generate strong, random passwords

🖼 Custom GUI with background image and intuitive layout

💾 Local data storage using SQLite

🔒 All passwords encrypted before being saved

This app is ideal for users who want a simple yet secure way to manage their credentials without relying on online tools. It’s fully customizable and a great intermediate project for those learning Python, GUI design, and encryption.
